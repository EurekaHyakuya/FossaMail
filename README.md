 # Project Labrastroodle


Project Labrastroodle is a Thunderbird-based mail/news client forked from the noe defunct FossaMail 27.x codebase.

The source tree is mostly laid out like the Mozilla Thunderbird tree and links to Pale Moon 
as a git sub-repo for easy management and updates of the back-end code.

## Important

Project Labrastroodle is currently pre-alpha in quality and I need some time to fully flush things out before new work can begin.
